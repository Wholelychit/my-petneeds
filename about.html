    <h2>Why Petneeds.ai Exists</h2>
    <p>
      Pet care information is everywhere — but it’s often overwhelming,
      inconsistent, or hard to trust. Petneeds.ai was created to simplify
      pet care by organizing reliable knowledge into clear, practical guidance.

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>
      We focus on education first. Petneeds.ai provides general care insights
      designed to support — not replace — professional veterinary care.
    </p>

    <h2>AI, Used Responsibly</h2>
    <p>
      As Petneeds.ai evolves, artificial intelligence will help personalize
      pet care insights based on species, age, lifestyle, and environment.
      Our goal is transparency, safety, and usefulness — not automation for its own sake.
    </p>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      We’re building Petneeds.ai step by step — starting with strong
      educational foundations and expanding toward smarter tools,
      thoughtful recommendations, and helpful reminders.
    </p>

  <section>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Petneeds.ai provides educational information
    only and does not replace advice from licensed veterinarians or animal
    health professionals.</p>
